# TokenKid

TokenKid is an app to track behavior tokens for your children. 
Basically I got tired of the kids losing or defacing my poker chips, 
nd decided that a mobile solution would be the best way to simply
sync between disparate mobile devices.

I was also lucky enough to be able to enlist the help of my friends
at Farm Credit Services of America on our irregularly-scheduled
"innovation time".

## Huh?

You can use this app if you are attempting to implement a 
[Token Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_economy) with your kids.
Basically you award and deduct points based on defined behaviors. The
points, or *tokens*, can be used to procure small prizes such as toys,
candy or privileges.

## How To Use

- Put in a username (could be your email, or whatever)
- Add your kids to the app
- Give other caretakers the same login
- Add and subtract points as needed
- ...
- Profit!
